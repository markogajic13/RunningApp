# RunningApp
RunningApp is a RESTful API running application developed using Java Spring Boot technology. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database and employs Thymeleaf as a Java XML/XHTML/HTML5 template engine, capable of functioning in both web (servlet-based) and non-web environments.

To launch this application, begin by setting up your PostgreSQL database either in pgAdmin 4 or in Intellij IDEA (if you have the paid version). Within the application.properties file of this project, modify the database name and input your PostgreSQL password. Upon downloading the application, it may be necessary to update some dependency versions.
